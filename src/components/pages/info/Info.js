          The best way to find out if Cleo childminding is the right place for
          you is by seeing it for yourself. Please speak to me about organising
          a visit.

          PLEASE NOTE: Due to new protocols surrounding Covid-19, visits may not
          be possible in the way described above. I will however ensure you and
          your child have opportunities to see the environment and meet me prior
          to starting.
